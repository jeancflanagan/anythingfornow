On Sunday we took advantage of one of the best weather days of the spring to head out to Shenandoah.

Though we’ve both been using the site for at least 10 years, [Hiking Upward](http://www.hikingupward.com/) still has a few hidden gems we’ve never hiked before. [Indian Grave Ridge](http://www.hikingupward.com/GWNF/IndianGraveRidge/) is a beautiful loop with river and mountain views and mossy, wildflower-strewn trails.

As usual, Sapphie was a motion-sickness mess in the car, but an ideal hiking companion on the trail, staying close at our heels and taking the climb with ease.
