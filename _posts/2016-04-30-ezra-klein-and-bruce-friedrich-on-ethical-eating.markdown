[The Ezra Klein show](https://overcast.fm/itunes1081584611/the-ezra-klein-show) has been turning out some great interviews. Though I’m a 7-year-strong vegetarian and someone who cares a lot about animal rights, I’ve never loved PETA or their tactics and was ready to cringe through the latest episode: an [interview with Bruce Friedrich](https://overcast.fm/+F_9Hzs9Cc), ex-director of PETA campaigns. However, I’ve followed the thoughtful things Ezra’s had to say about food over the years, and his description of Bruce turned out to be quite accurate:

> He was also one of the smartest, most informed, and most thoughtful experts I’d found on animal suffering.

For me, being on the vegetarian-vegan spectrum has never been about the label or the (ugh!) “purity.” I believe in a much more rational impact-based approach, and was surprised to hear the ex-PETA evangelist advocate a surprisingly pragmatic message:

If there are certain things you think you just can’t give up, like cream in your coffee, or turkey on Thanksgiving – consider just *not giving those things up*.

Crazy, right? A “vegan” who takes cream in their coffee? But if the alternative is eating hamburgers every week of the year because you “just couldn’t hack it” and threw your hands up, the difference in overall impact is huge.
