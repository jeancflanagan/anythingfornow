[Michelle Nijhuis](http://www.michellenijhuis.com/) has written a beautiful and concise [guide to the science essay](http://www.amazon.com/Science-Writers-Essay-Handbook-Compelling/dp/0692654666/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=).

I highly recommend reading the whole book, but this bit from Chapter 1 steals the show:

> Good essays have more in common with good science, in that they begin not with a thesis but, more tentatively, with a question… While scientists test their hypotheses through experiments in the laboratory or field, essayists search for answers through interviewing, reading, and the process of writing and revising. Both scientists and essayists acknowledge their conclusions are provisional. But by collecting reliable data data and thinking clearly and creatively scientists and essayists alike contribute to a larger, longer conversation.

It’s a great explanation for why I’ve always found science “news” rather dull, but everything *[Aeon](https://aeon.co/)* magazine publishes irresistible.
